# truffle-pet-shop-contract

## Overview
This is a solidity contract based on eth blockchain, used to manage a pet store. It was originally set up by [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) as a guide to using their framework to develop, deploy and test smart contracts and dapps generally.

## How to build
To build and test this smart contract, you need to have these apps installed:
- NodeJS
- Ganache by truffle
- Git

Open your terminal and run `npm install -g truffle`. This command installs truffle globally.

Then open Ganache and start - this is a mock eth blockchain we can use to test our dapp.

Go back to your terminal and run `truffle compile`. 

You should get an output that ends with something like this

```
> Compiled successfully using:
   - solc: 0.5.0+commit.1d4f565a.Emscripten.clang
```
Then, run `truffle migrate`, which does the actual contract migration to the blockchain and charge gas.

You will notice this on Ganache. Some eth would be deducted from the balance of the first address. ðŸš€
